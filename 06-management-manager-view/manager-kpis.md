# Recommended KPIs - Management / Manager View

This page defines **management-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** aligned to the **Management / Manager View** of the SABSA framework.

These KPIs measure **leadership effectiveness, governance maturity, and strategic execution**, enabling executives to validate that security is being directed, governed, and improved in a risk-informed manner.

## Governance Notes

- Management KPIs are **outcome-focused**, not operational.
- Metrics should:
  - Be reviewed at executive and board governance levels
  - Inform investment, prioritisation, and risk acceptance decisions
  - Be supported by evidence from lower architectural layers
- KPI targets should evolve as organisational maturity increases.

---

## Traceability

Management KPIs must be traceable to:

- Business objectives and risk appetite
- Architectural principles and control objectives
- Operational performance and improvement initiatives

Metrics that do not influence leadership decisions or strategic direction should be retired.
