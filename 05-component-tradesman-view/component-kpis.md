# Recommended KPIs - Component / Tradesman View

This page defines **component-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** aligned to the **Component / Tradesman View** of the SABSA framework.

These KPIs measure **operational execution, control ownership, and continuous improvement effectiveness** across implemented security components and processes.

## Component Execution KPIs

| Category | Metric | Purpose / Outcome |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Governance & Ownership** | % of controls with assigned accountable owners | Confirms full accountability and traceability of control ownership. |
| **Configuration & Change Management** | % of infrastructure-as-code deployments passing security validation | Validates secure baseline enforcement during provisioning and change. |
| **Incident Response & Recovery** | Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) / Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) | Demonstrates operational readiness and response effectiveness. |
| **Threat Intelligence & Analytics** | % of threat intelligence feeds validated and correlated in monitoring platforms | Ensures actionable, high-quality intelligence integration. |
| **Continuous Improvement & Metrics** | % of improvement actions closed within agreed timelines | Confirms governance follow-through and sustained program maturity. |

## Governance Notes

- Tradesman KPIs focus on **execution quality**, not architectural intent.
- Metrics should:
  - Be derived directly from operational systems and workflows
  - Be reviewed regularly in operational and management governance forums
  - Trigger corrective actions when thresholds are breached
- KPI targets should be realistic, risk-informed, and continuously raised as maturity improves.

---

## Traceability

Component KPIs must be traceable to:

- Physical control implementations
- Logical control objectives
- Management performance and risk reporting

Metrics that do not inform decision making or improvement actions should be retired.
