# Conceptual – Architect View

## Purpose

The Conceptual / Architect View defines **what security must achieve** in order to support business objectives and manage risk.

This view translates the **business drivers and risk posture** defined in the Contextual / Business View into a **set of security principles, capabilities, and architectural intent** that guide all downstream design and implementation decisions.

At this level, security is expressed in terms of **principles and outcomes**, independent of specific technologies or vendors.

---

## Architectural Scope

This view focuses on:

- Security principles and architectural intent
- Enterprise-wide security capabilities
- Trust and threat assumptions
- Control objectives derived from business risk
- Consistent guidance for design and implementation teams

No platform-specific designs, configurations, or tooling decisions are defined here.

## Relationship to Other Views

The Conceptual / Architect View acts as the **architectural bridge** between business context and technical design:

- It **derives principles** from the Contextual / Business View
- It **guides logical control design** in the Logical / Designer View
- It **constrains technology choices** in the Physical / Builder View
- It **anchors governance and assurance** in the Management / Manager View

All security designs and controls must be traceable back to this view.

## Security Principles

Security principles define **how the organisation approaches protection and risk management**.  
They are stable over time and apply consistently across domains and platforms.

The following principles form the conceptual foundation of the architecture.
